## Description

This will be a paper-based exercise, meaning there will not be any active assessment activities such as
penetration testing. However, this is not unusual in the cybersecurity industry for many reasons,
including:

* Some systems – such as those involving critical infrastructure – are not suited for active
assessment activities. For example, some industrial control systems can be damaged by a simple
network scan.  
* The only systems an organization has may be their “production” systems, and disruption of
those could impact business operations.
* The organization is still in the design and implementation stage of the system, and a working
system does not yet exist.
* The organization does not have the resources to support an active assessment. For example,
they may not have an IT person that can quickly restore systems to their original state after it
has been compromised
